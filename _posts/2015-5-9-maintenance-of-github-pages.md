###Recovery
      $ git log --pretty=oneline

this is to look formal commit

      $ git reset --hard 1a410efbd2fdkaldafdkajfdklds059dd55cfe9

this command is to recover the formal commit using SHA

###Install jekyll
在中国，jekyll所在的网站是被屏蔽的，所以需要用vpn翻墙才能成功执行install jekyll命令x,否则会报超时。

      $ sudo gem update --system

update the gem to latest version

      $ sudo gem install jekyll

install jekyll

if you want to install rails, the command is the same

      $ sudo gem install rails

###jekyll
     
      $ jekyll serve --watch --baseurl ""

this will run the jekyll server, and type the 127.0.0.1:4000 to the url column, you can test or debug the local project

###Google Custom Search Engine(gcse)
First, you need to submit your website and sitemap to google, otherwise, there would be no result. 
[click here to submit google webmasters](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en)
Second, customize your google custom search engine API at [here](https://cse.google.com/cse/all)
Finally, If you customize your search engine API and use gcse:searchresults-only featrue,pay attention to the "Query Parameter Name" which has to be given your input name. This problem had costed me half a day to settle down. Otherwise, you can not see any response on the result page after submit your search request. 

###Google Analytics
Click [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics) to creat your account.

A good way to test if it was well set, click your website url and see the Reporting-->Real-Time-->Overview menu if there would be new sessions and new active pages.
