I had an exiting on-site interview at Syncsort yesterday. Everyone was kind and friendly and the environment is elegant. The office building is surrounded by a peaceful lake, trees, huge area of lawns and a big parking lot. The moment I entered in, I felt like I am in a modern and quiet garden. Sunshine falls everywhere from the roof and down to the middle of a pool with fishes and a typical American style coffee shop appears at the base floor. The temperature is mild and the air is fresh and clean. Also my interview went smoothly. I really wish to get the offer. Bellow is the general process of my interview.

At 9:45AM, I met with Fernanda who is the Director of Big Data Unit. She first asked me to design and test a class. Then told me the general function about the product she is working on and told me how test works. Then ask me to ask her questions. We had a very pleasant conversation.

At 10:30AM, it was test manager, Alchim, who give me a question about how to design a test. But I have little experience in full regular software testing. So I tried my best give my own idea.

At 11:10AM, HR, Elise, who had a very short conversation with me and sent me to support manager.

At 11:30AM, Chris, the support manager, who ask me to solve a question about how to join two giant files. I think I had given a correct idea, but finally I was stuck by the best solution. And he finally told me the solution.

At 12:30PM, two engineers, Jeff and Nicolas, went out to have lunch with me at a traditional Italian restaurant, the dishes are amazing and they are very friendly.

At 13:40PM, I went to meet with software Architect, Mr.Wang. He asked me a lot about my past experiences. And I was pleased to share all my stories to him. He gave me praise about my depth-drill of my previous works.

At 15:00PM, an outstanding software Architect, Ana, who gave me questions about computer architecture and problem analysis. After that she asked me to write code to solve two problems. At the beginning I was not easy to figure out the solution. But things went well at last.

At 16:00, I went back to Fernanda, and that was the end of the interview.

It is amazing that a software company with various products have so little engineers. I think that is the reason why they hire an intern so serious and prudent. Good luck to myself.
