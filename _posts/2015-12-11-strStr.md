  For a given source string and a target string, you should output the first index(from 0) of target string in source string.

  If target does not exist in source, just return -1.
  O(n2) is acceptable. Can you implement an O(n) algorithm?
when you meet this problem in a real interview, the interviewer may just want to test your basic implementation ability. But make sure your confirm with the interviewer first.

    int strStr(const char *source, const char *target) {
        if (source == NULL||target == NULL) {
        return -1;
