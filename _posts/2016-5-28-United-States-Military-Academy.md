One week ago, I visited United States Military Academy by the 2-hours tour with a guide. Since it locates at West Point we usually call it West Point Military Academy . It is famous not only for its contribution to the world and rigorous discipline but also for its invention of modern civilization. West Point has a gene of loyalty, engineering, and sports. Let me talk about some fabulous stories about it.

## First impression

It is huge and beautiful. According to the guide, this school covers 16080 acres. On the south side, it is half surrounded by Hudson River which is 300 miles long. On the north, it is surrounded by a continuous mountain. No more than 1 miles trip, we had seen two huge lawns, a residential village, a lake, a huge cemetery, three sub-colleges each contains at least two churches, 2 statues, 4 Olympics standard swimming pools, 1 stadium, 8 tennis court, 1 huge gym include at least 10 basketball court, wrestling, boxing, softball etc. God, it is like a tremendous size of an Olympic town. I have never seen such a big school before.

## Sports and Loyalty
Sport is very important for this school. They training various athletes programs. Every cadet is required to pass boxing training course including female cadet. This school has about 18 football teams and they hold games annually.

Honor is the most important thing in West Point. This has a story came from a half hero half traitor in West Point history. so there has a plate in the church with rank but the name being erased. Why? Here is the detail.

From thousand of wars, Thayer, a very well-known general, who bring "Honor Code" to West Point tells that cadets are required to adhere to the Cadet Honor Code, which states that "a cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do." This man was brought to Europ to study their experiences and technologies.  He had learned 30 thousand books in Europ and finally bring various technologies and inventions including "Honor Code" to West Point which made it world famous.

## Culture

Class size: no more than 18 student is one class, this can guarantee every student can learn and grow.  There are 40 majors in WP.

Backyard Bird is the nickname of who break the rules of discipline very seriously in West Point. why? Because cadet who makes jokes with their professors or brings alcohol to dorm will be punished to walk in the backyard. The time varies but very long. For example, being late for training will be punished to walk 36 hours. So some naughty guys can be backyard bird day and time for two weeks.

Dining. There is a huge dining hall in West Point which requires all 4000 cadets to have meal in it. This building can be one of the largest building in this school, it looks like the one in movie Harrie Porter which has a 6- floors high and thousands of desks in it. 12 cadet seating around a dest and waiting for a teacher speak with an audio amplifier to give commands. Everyone only has 20 minutes to finish their meal.

## Contributions
There are many famous general and stories in West Point, which contributes a lot to the world. For example, Panama Canal was finished by George W. Goethals who also invented the major civil engineer.
 It is Henry Harley who invented the U.S. Air Force which later influence the world's army formation.

## Finally
Not only West Point but other organization and individuals can do a lot to the world. Information technology has changed the world greatly.  Computer Visualization and Big Data is affecting our lives, let us make the system more efficient and make the world runs more smoothly.
